# Write a program that receives an input from the user and then
# returns the same input with Return lowercase letters as output.
# Punctuation and spacing between words should appear unchanged in the output.
# Also, you don't need to explicitly receive input from the user,
# and you can add a string to Give the title of the input argument
# to the program when running the code.
